          "Earlier this week, word started spreading that Lenovo had been pre-installing a sketchy adware program called “SuperFish” onto many of its Windows PCs for months.

Then researchers started finding nasty vulnerabilities — namely, that SuperFish was using some pretty ugly hacks to tinker with your computer’s encryption certificates, and doing so in a way that seemingly leaves your otherwise “encrypted” communications (everything that goes over HTTPS) unsecure whenever you’re on a shared WiFi connection (like at a coffee shop)

By this morning, the US Department of Homeland Security was urging Lenovo laptop owners to remove the tool.

Even without the security implications, SuperFish was pretty sketchy. Its purpose? Catch Google search results before they hit your screen, then quietly modify them to include more ads.

Lenovo is now rushing to put out the fires; they disclosed yesterday that they’d turned off everything SuperFish-related on the server side back in January — which, while a good step, doesn’t fix the problem of the ugly security flaws lurking in the laptops."
